"""
Find a way of coloring the vertices of a *undirected* graph such that no
two adjacent vertices are colored using same color.

"This problem is a known NP Complete problem. This solution doesnâ€™t guarantee
to use minimum colors, but it guarantees an upper bound on the number of colors.
The basic algorithm never uses more than d+1 colors where d is the maximum
degree of a vertex in the given graph."

Applications:
    "The problem of coloring a graph arises in many practical areas such
    as pattern matching, sports scheduling, designing seating plans, exam
    timetabling, the scheduling of taxis, and solving Sudoku puzzles.

    Vertex coloring models to a number of scheduling problems. For example,
    when assigning aircraft to flights, the resulting conflict graph is an
    interval graph, so the coloring problem can be solved efficiently. In
    bandwidth allocation to radio stations, the resulting conflict graph
    is a unit disk graph, so the coloring problem is 3-approximable." [Wikipedia]

Complexity: O(V^2 + E)
    Where V is the number of vertices and E the number of edges
