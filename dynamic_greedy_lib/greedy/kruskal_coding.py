    Description:
        "Kruskal's algorithm is a minimum-spanning-tree algorithm which finds an edge of the least possible
         weight that connects any two trees in the forest.It is a greedy algorithm in graph theory as it 
         finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph adding increasing cost arcs at each step. 
         This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total 
         weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. If the graph is not connected, then it finds a minimum spanning forest 
         (a minimum spanning tree for each connected component)." [Wikipedia]

    Complexity: O(ElogE) or O(ElogV)
        Where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices.

    Applications:
        "The standard application is to a problem like phone network design. You have a business with several offices; 
        you want to lease phone lines to connect them up with each other; and the phone company charges different 
        amounts of money to connect different pairs of cities. You want a set of lines that connects all your offices with a 
        minimum total cost. It should be a spanning tree, since if a network isnâ€™t a tree you can always remove some edges and 
        save money." [GeeksforGeeks]
