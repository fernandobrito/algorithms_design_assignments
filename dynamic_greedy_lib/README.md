# Dynamic and Greedy Algorithms 

## Usage

## Development guidelines

Python 3.4.

Keep it simple. Only one public function, called `solve`, which takes an array as argument. 
Other functions should be prefixed with a single underscore.

Check `dynamic_algorithms/edit_distance.py` for comment header template.
